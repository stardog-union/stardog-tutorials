# Table Mappings

This example shows SQL table mappings to expose the RDF graph in a Stardog database as a SQL database via Stardog's 
built-in [BI/SQL](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_business_intelligence_tools_and_sql_queries) server. The [mappings](music_table_mappings.ttl)
here were [automatically generated](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_auto_generated_schema_mappings) from the [SHACL constraints](../shacl/music_shacl.ttl)
using the [`data model`](https://www.stardog.com/docs/man/data-model) command.
